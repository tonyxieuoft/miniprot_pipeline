# Overview

This script automates sequence-homology-based gene prediction via miniprot. See Li et al. 2023 for more details (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad014).

# Requirements

The repository can be cloned with the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/tonyxieuoft/miniprot_pipeline.git`

The python package `Bio` must be installed (details can be found here: https://biopython.org/wiki/Download). 

Other installation requirements include:
- miniprot 
- AGAT, a .gff file processor
We recommend downloading the above into a conda environment (see https://anaconda.org/bioconda/miniprot, https://anaconda.org/bioconda/agat for more details).
